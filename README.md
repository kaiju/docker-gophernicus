# docker-gophernicus

An Alpine Linux based Docker image for the [Gophernicus Gopher server](https://github.com/gophernicus/gophernicus).

Do you just want to run a simple Gopher service? Do you not want to mess the hassle of setting up old-school inetd/xinetd/systemd sockets/etc? Are you already running all your other services as containers? Me too!

This image runs Gophernicus via xinetd on an Alpine Linux base for a Docker image that weighs in at just a smidge under 7MB. Set your hostname, map your favorite volume at `/var/gopher`, bind port 70 and go!

ex:
```
docker run --name gophernicus \
	--hostname <your gopher hostname> \
	-p 70:70 \
	-v <your gopher root>:/var/gopher \
	joshkaiju/gophernicus
```

## Configuration

Set the hostname of your container to the FQDN of your gopher site to ensure that links work correctly.

The majority of [Gophernicus settings](https://github.com/gophernicus/gophernicus#command-line-options) can be configured via environment variables. All Gophernicus defaults apply except where otherwise noted.
